### ComputationalQuantumMechanics-CL

Hi, this is the equivalent of my other repository, the content reflects "Computational Quantum Mechanics" by Joshua Izaac & Jingbo Wang. the language chose, in this case, is common lisp. As I just started learning the language there might be few mistakes, feel free to point them out by emailing  [rndmemex@cantab.net](mailto:rndmemex@cantab.net)
